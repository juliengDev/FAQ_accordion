# FAQ Accordion Component

![Design preview for the FAQ accordion coding challenge](/public/images/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Overview

This project is an interactive FAQ accordion component that allows users to view and hide answers to frequently asked questions. It was developed with a focus on accessibility and responsiveness, adhering to best practices in front-end development.

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

### Built With

- TypeScript
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS for advanced styling
- Mobile-first workflow
- Accessibility-first approach

### What I Learned

This project allowed me to deepen my knowledge of creating interactive components with a focus on accessibility. Here are some key takeaways:

1. Implementing ARIA attributes for improved screen reader support
2. Managing keyboard navigation for accordion components
3. Creating smooth transitions for accordion panels
4. Implementing responsive design for various screen sizes

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to focus on:

- Implementing more complex accordion behaviors (e.g., allowing multiple open panels)
- Exploring advanced animation techniques for smoother transitions
- Enhancing keyboard navigation patterns for improved accessibility

### Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs on ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) - This helped me understand how to properly implement ARIA attributes for improved accessibility.
- [CSS-Tricks Guide to CSS Animations](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/) - An excellent resource for understanding CSS transitions and animations.
- [W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) - Provides guidelines and best practices for creating accessible web content.
